Bricolage in social
entrepreneurship
How creative resource mobilization fosters
greater social impact
Sophie Bacq, Laurel F. Ofstein, Jill R. Kickul and Lisa K. Gundry
Abstract: Social entrepreneurs face unique challenges in their dual
pursuit of social and financial value creation to address pressing societal
problems. While social entrepreneurs’ behaviour and actions have been
highlighted as an important source of creativity and innovation, this issue
has largely been underresearched in the field of entrepreneurship. This
paper explores the role of social entrepreneurs’ bricolage behaviour in
enabling their enterprises to scale their operations. The authors test their
hypothesis on a unique database of 123 social enterprises using an online
survey. They find a positive relationship between entrepreneurial
bricolage and the scaling of social impact. The paper concludes with
study implications, post hoc analyses and limitations and directions for
future research.

The expansion of existing frameworks of new venture
creation and growth in the social arena has led to the
emergence of new theoretical and practical contributions
centred on the creation of social value for disenfranchised members of society. Social entrepreneurs pursue
social improvements and enhancements for their
constituents, including their marketplace and communities, as well as a favourable return on investments to
their key stakeholders. The success of social entrepreneurial firms is determined by their innovations,
outcomes and scaling of social impact rather than by the
measurement of firm size, growth rate and processes. As
evidenced by recent research, social entrepreneurship is
abundant and thrives in resource-constrained environments within neighbourhoods and villages around the
world (Desa, 2007), requiring social entrepreneurs to
pursue innovative solutions to some of society’s most
pressing and challenging problems.
While social entrepreneurship is solidly grounded in
the theoretical tradition of entrepreneurship research
(Dees et al, 2001; Mair and Martí, 2006) and social and
commercial entrepreneurship both address similar
284 ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION Vol 16, No 4
Bricolage in social entrepreneurship
conceptual areas of inquiry related to opportunity
recognition, evaluation and implementation (Shane and
Venkataraman, 2000), social ventures are distinct from
commercial ones in several significant areas. These
include the social nature of the opportunities these
entrepreneurs discover and pursue, motivation inspired
by distinct missions, the ways in which resources are
mobilized and the methods to assess performance,
including social wealth and impact (Austin et al, 2006;
Zahra et al, 2008, 2009). Indeed, superior performance
in the context of social entrepreneurship can be measured in terms of scaling of social impact: that is, a social
enterprise’s ability to scale its reach so as to address the
magnitude of a social need or problem more effectively
(Dees, 2008). As such, scaling of social impact is
considered one of the key dependent variables in the
field (see also the search conducted in the EBSCO
journal database by Desa and Koch, 2014, p 148).
Realizing greater social impact may depend on the
extent to which social entrepreneurs can combine and
apply the resources they have to new problems and
opportunities – a pattern of behaviour known as
‘bricolage’ (Baker and Nelson, 2005). Operating within
penurious environments, social bricoleurs are likely to
engage in these processes as a means to discover unique
and novel ways of solving social problems and addressing unmet needs, accessing human and financial capital
to implement their ideas, and remedying any strategic
weaknesses that obstruct their pursuit of desired social
improvements (Anthony et al, 2008).
Despite its importance, the topic of bricolage in social
entrepreneurship has mainly been treated at the theoretical level, or explored by means of small samples of
empirical cases. In addition, few formalized tools to
measure social performance exist, even in practice
(Renko, 2013). As a result, past research aiming to
measure and explain social impact has been inconsistent. Therefore, more quantitative, predictive studies of
the strategic success factors that produce and help scale
social impact are needed (Battle Anderson, 2005; Short
et al, 2009). This paper aims to close this gap by
adopting a more rigorous approach to study the nature
of bricolage within social entrepreneurial firms. Specifically, this paper investigates the influence of bricolage
on social entrepreneurial firms’ scaling of social impact.
After reviewing recent research conducted on bricolage
in social entrepreneurship, we propose a rationale as to
why social entrepreneurial firms using bricolage are
expected to have a greater social impact. We then
present our methodology and quantitatively test our
hypothesis on a unique dataset of 123 social enterprises.
We discuss our findings and their implications for future
research and summarize our contributions before
concluding.
Conceptual background
Bricolage in entrepreneurship research
Bricolage is a well developed pattern of behaviour first
proposed by Lévi-Strauss (1967) to suggest the creation
of something new through actors involved in the process
of recombination and transformation of existing resources (Venkataraman, 1997; Garud et al, 1998; Baker
and Nelson, 2005). These resources can be material or
non-material (for example, skills and knowledge) and
quite extensive in nature. For instance, entrepreneurs
can engage in bricolage with regard to customers,
financing sources and structures, office space, networks
and social capital, and employees and volunteers – what
Baker and Nelson described as the bricoleur’s ‘trove’
(2005, p 344).
Examining bricolage from an entrepreneurship
perspective, Fisher (2012) described the patterns of
behaviour that entrepreneur-bricoleurs were likely to
demonstrate. Adapted from the work of Baker and
Nelson (2005) and Senyard and colleagues (2009), these
include an action orientation to problem-solving,
characterized by experimentation rather than
conceptualization of challenges, and using accessible
and available, sometimes self-taught skills, existing
contacts and resources on hand to develop solutions.
Some of the resources used by bricoleurs can be
repurposed or used in divergent ways from their original
intention. Fisher (2012) also noted that these entrepreneurs were often willing to work around existing rules
and standards (referred to as institutional environments),
with sometimes surprising and unexpected results.
As such, bricolage involves an iterative problemsolving process through which alternative ideas and
solutions can be generated, evaluated and implemented
potentially to address critical needs and challenges.
Some scholars have posited that entrepreneurs who
operate under significant resource limitations will
demonstrate higher levels of creativity in new product
and service development than founders with ample
resources for their enterprises (Fisher, 2012). The
process of understanding how resource-scarcity innovations occur has not been well explored, and bricolage
can contribute to a fuller explanation of how these
innovations arise (Linna, 2013). It is likely that resource-poor innovators invent or discover resourceful
innovation in unanticipated ways (Välikangas and
Gibbert, 2008; Halme et al, 2012). In addition, as noted
by Stinchfield et al (2013), bricoleurs are not motivated
by financial performance and, with little debt, they are
capable of surviving in any economic context, austere or
munificent.
Therefore, based on the observation that social
entrepreneurs thrive in resource-constrained environ-
ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION Vol 16, No 4 285
Bricolage in social entrepreneurship
ments (Desa and Basu, 2013), and that by definition
these entrepreneurs are motivated by social impact over
financial performance, we contend that bricolage
behaviour will enable social entrepreneurs to achieve
breakthrough innovations for social change as they
create and grow their firms and, as a result, scale their
social impact. We develop these ideas next.
Bricolage in social entrepreneurship: using what is on
hand to scale social impact
Bricolage in social entrepreneurship encompasses a set
of actions driven by the pursuit of existing and often
scarce resources that can be combined to create innovative and valuable solutions that bring positive social
change to markets and communities (Gundry et al,
2011). The practice of bricolage in social entrepreneurship is widespread, as indicated in a study of 202
technology social ventures in 45 countries (Desa, 2012).
While social entrepreneurs around the world tend to
operate in resource-constrained environments, those
working in developing countries probably face even
more extreme constraints (for example, living in contexts plagued by long-standing conflicts, bad
governance, inadequate or non-existent support of
entrepreneurship). Yet these innovator-entrepreneurs
have been found to overcome these constraints and to
persist in creating workable technical solutions and in
designing sustainable business models (Linna, 2013).
Indeed, the continual experimentation and recombination of resources by bricoleurs is a creative process,
often improvisational (Weick, 1993; Baker et al, 2003).
As such, bricoleurs have been described as tinkerers
searching for new, unexpected cultural resources
(Miettinen and Virkkunen, 2005) – that is, ‘the norms,
values, roles, language, attitudes, beliefs, identities, and
aesthetic expressions of a community’ (Dacin et al,
2010, p 49). Dacin and colleagues (2010) further argue
that social entrepreneurs’ ability to collect, understand
and leverage cultural knowledge constitutes a key
resource to draw from as they develop successful social
ventures.
Social entrepreneurs undertake major efforts to create
solutions to complex problems using approaches that are
both scalable and sustainable. These catalytic innovations (Christensen et al, 2006) provide ‘good enough’
solutions to social challenges that are not adequately met
by established organizations deploying traditional
methods and solutions. In a study of social entrepreneurs’ use of bricolage, results disclosed that they were
able to develop novel methods to attract and distribute
resources, identify over-served or unserved market
segments, and offer products and services that were
simpler, less costly and ‘good enough’ (Gundry et al,
2011). A bricolage approach to technology innovation
can be illustrated by a low-tech design that ramps up
progressively and is ultimately able to prevail over a
high-tech breakthrough approach, transforming on a
gradual basis to greater degrees of functionality (Garud
and Karnoe, 2003).
The key question we address in this paper concerns
the relationship between bricolage and the scaling of
social impacts that social entrepreneurs have on markets
and communities. We turn to it in the next section.
Bricolage as a driver of scaling social impact
Building on Desa and Koch, we define scaling social
impact as ‘the process of expanding or adapting an
organization’s output to better match the magnitude of
the social need or problem being tackled’ (2014, p 148).
Scaling social impact can further be interpreted in two
categories: ‘breadth impact’ and ‘depth impact’. On the
one hand, breadth impact refers to the quantitative
growth of impact, designed to reflect geographic
expansion or increases in the number of people benefiting from the solution. On the other hand, depth impact
refers to a qualitative improvement in terms of development of product/service scope in serving the needs of
the target community.
In this paper, we propose that social entrepreneurs’
bricolage behaviour generates innovative solutions to
social problems of large amplitude, and is thus likely
to be positively associated with greater scaling of
social impact. Indeed, recent research by Senyard and
colleagues (2014) has noted a strong connection
between bricolage and innovativeness, considered as a
tool that helps entrepreneurs in new ventures become
more innovative in spite of the resource limitations
they face. Yet extant research has overlooked the study
of the relationship between bricolage and scaling of
social impact. One notable exception is Smith and
Stevens (2010) who build on and extend Zahra and
colleagues’ (2009) typology of social entrepreneurs by
linking it to different approaches of measurement and
scaling of social value. Consistent with the core tenets
of embeddedness, according to which the web of
relations in which social entrepreneurs are embedded
may influence their scaling decision, these authors
argue that the ‘social bricoleur’ type of social entrepreneurship tends to focus on local concerns. This can be
explained by the fact that the ‘social bricoleur’ type of
social entrepreneurship has a network consisting
primarily of embedded ties to various stakeholders in a
local community. While such a high degree of structural embeddedness fosters trust and bounded
solidarity, it can also constrain the choices available to
social entrepreneurs aspiring to scale their solutions in
order to serve the communities in need better. As a
result, social bricoleurs’ local focus being both a
286 ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION Vol 16, No 4
Bricolage in social entrepreneurship
source of opportunity and a route to measuring success, solutions developed by that type of entrepreneur
tend to be small in scale and scope (Smith and
Stevens, 2010).
These arguments are further nuanced by Desa and
Koch (2014), who propose, based on an analysis of two
scaling social enterprises, that bricolage is related to
depth rather than breadth impact. Their in-depth
qualitative research indicates that bricolage indeed
allows the social enterprise to develop the necessary
cultural resources so as to adapt its product offerings to
the variety of rural socioeconomic needs at low costs.
Bricolage is thus conducive to the growth of social
impact depth. While they warn that social entrepreneurs
using bricolage may face difficulties to scale beyond the
idiosyncratic conditions of the initial site, Desa and
Koch (2014) also highlight some conditions under
which social bricoleurs may be able to scale their impact
broadly, for instance, in revolutionary periods, when
new information becomes available and changes the
status quo. Finally, in line with Smith and Stevens’s
(2010) embeddedness approach, they found that social
entrepreneurs’ ‘trust-based ties in local districts provided the initial political support and subsequent
impetus to expand to new geographic markets’ (Desa
and Koch, 2014, p 161). Although some contingencies
may be at play, this earlier research seems to indicate
that social entrepreneurs who adopt bricolage behaviour
are more likely to develop the ability to scale their social
impact better to match the magnitude of the social
problem they are trying to address. Therefore, we
formulate our main hypothesis as follows:
Hypothesis: Bricolage is positively related to the
scaling of social impact for social entrepreneurial
firms.
Methodology
Participants
We surveyed 123 social entrepreneurs of organizations
whose business activities are directly involved with and
primarily working in the social enterprise sector (such as
for-profit social ventures or not-for-profit organizations). The social entrepreneurs and their respective
firms were sampled through an existing social entrepreneurship university database. The social entrepreneurs
serve a number of social sectors, including education,
environment, mental health, hunger, arts and culture,
and social capital investing.
All information was gathered from the social entrepreneurs over a two-week period, utilizing an online
survey. This means of data collection is consistent with
our research questions and addresses the gap in social
entrepreneurship research of quantitative, hypothesistesting studies claimed by Short et al (2009). We
followed Dillman’s (2007) recommendations for
effective questionnaire design and survey implementation, as well as design procedures idiosyncratic to
Internet surveys. We initially pre-tested the electronic
survey with a dozen social entrepreneurs. Participants in
the study were assured that their individual responses
would remain confidential. Upon completion of the
survey, their responses were submitted to a secure
Internet database.
Measures
Entrepreneurial bricolage. To assess entrepreneurial
bricolage behaviour, we used an eight-item scale
developed by Steffens et al (2009) who used the standard protocols for scale development. In deriving their
scale, they created items that were consistent with Baker
and Nelson’s definition of bricolage as ‘making do by
applying combinations of the resources at hand to new
problems and opportunities’ (2005, p 333). Items
included: ‘We are confident of our ability to find
workable solutions to new challenges by using our
existing resources’; ‘We gladly take on a broader range
of challenges than others with our resources would be
able to’; ‘We use any existing resource that seems useful
to responding to a new problem or opportunity’; ‘We
deal with new challenges by applying a combination of
our existing resources and other resources inexpensively
available to us’; ‘When dealing with new problems or
opportunities we take action by assuming that we will
find a workable solution’; ‘By combining our existing
resources, we take on a surprising variety of new
challenges’; ‘When we face new challenges we put
together workable solutions from our existing resources’; and ‘We combine resources to accomplish new
challenges that the resources weren’t originally intended
to accomplish’. Social entrepreneurs indicated their
level of agreement with the statements above on a
seven-point Likert scale (1 = ‘strongly disagree’; 7 =
‘strongly agree’). The internal reliability of the scale
was 0.78, above the accepted threshold of 0.70 defined
in Nunnally (1978).
Scaling of social impact. To measure scaling of social
impact, we created a six-item scale that included the
following items: ‘Our organization’s approach allows us
to serve potentially large groups of people’; ‘We are
able to improve our offerings by expanding market
reach (e.g., offering services to more people, adding
locations, etc.)’; ‘We have scaled up our capabilities to
address our mission’; ‘We have greatly expanded the
ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION Vol 16, No 4 287
Bricolage in social entrepreneurship
number of individuals we serve’; ‘We have substantially
increased the geographic area we serve’; and ‘Our work
and approach is transferable to other locations’. The
internal reliability of our scale was 0.79, also above the
accepted threshold.
Results
To test our hypothesis, we conducted a linear regression
analysis by means of one overall model, using scaling as
the dependent variable and entrepreneurial bricolage as
the independent predictor variable. We found a positive
linear relationship between entrepreneurial bricolage
and scaling of social impact (r = 0.41; adjusted R2
 =
0.15; p < 0.001). Our hypothesis was confirmed, leading
us to conclude that entrepreneurial bricolage behaviour
was indeed positively and significantly related to the
scaling of social impact for social entrepreneurial firms.
Discussion and implications
Discussion of findings
When assessing a social venture in a resource-constrained environment, financial performance measures
are generally not the best means of assessing value.
Rather, expected social impact (Perrini and Vurro,
2006), brought about by providing products and/or
services targeted towards fulfilling societal needs and
having a long-term impact on society, is a more appropriate measure (Brock and Steiner, 2008). The social
impact measure represents the ability to address social
needs and problems, thus addressing them on a greater
scale, and is a key variable in determining the performance of the social entrepreneurial firm. Our study’s
empirical finding shows that bricolage is an essential
tool for achieving scaling of social impact in a resourceconstrained setting.
Our finding further led to the question of whether
bricolage had diminishing returns in terms of scaling
social impact for social entrepreneurial firms. That is,
would there be a point at which bricolage behaviour
actually limited the social enterprise’s ability to scale its
social impact? Several studies have suggested that while
creative use of resources can lead to success in a social
venture, an overreliance on this approach may create
limitations, and even the potential for negative outcomes
(Harper, 1987; Ciborra, 1996; Lanzara, 1999; Baker et
al, 2003; Baker and Nelson, 2005). Senyard et al (2014)
hypothesized that the favourable outcomes of bricolage
might face boundary conditions, such that social
entrepreneurs might encounter inefficiencies due to
following a trial-and-error approach (Ciborra, 1996) or
might not be able to sustain successful outcomes due to
the resources on hand being inadequate for the desired
outcomes (Campbell, 1965; Jacob, 1977; Nelson, 1995;
Aldrich, 1999). The boundary condition tested by
Senyard et al (2014) was looking at the relationship
between bricolage and innovativeness due to wasted
efforts, satisficing behaviour and avoidance of interactions with stakeholders including competent suppliers
and demanding clients. The positive relationship
between these variables, which was hypothesized to
flatten and then decline as bricolage increased, was not
supported in the analysis.
Despite the findings in Senyard et al (2014), the
question of boundary conditions for the beneficial
outcomes of bricolage in scaling social impact still
exists. Thus, we conducted a post hoc analysis of the
relationship between bricolage and scaling of social
impact to see whether an inverted U-shaped relationship
would emerge, suggesting diminishing returns, and then
possibly a negative relationship between the constructs.
Our findings support an inverted U-shaped relationship
between bricolage and scaling of social impact (adjusted
R2
 = 0.17, p < 0.001), such that, as bricolage behaviour
increases, the influence on scaling of social impact
becomes less pronounced, and then actually begins to
diminish the very point of the enterprise – to sustain and
grow the positive social impact that matches the amplitude of the problem.
This post hoc finding suggests that further research is
warranted to examine the point at which social entrepreneurial firms should move away from the bricolage
approach to more of a resource mobilization process.
While quantitative research can show us the direction
this relationship may take, qualitative studies may lead
to identifying key indicators that the firm has reached
the limit on the benefits this approach can provide.
Future research is also needed to understand better why
the effects of bricolage on innovation are not affected by
boundary conditions (as per Senyard et al, 2014) in the
same way as the effects on scaling of social impact.
Limitations and future research avenues
As with any research study, ours is not without limitations. The relationship between bricolage and the
scaling of social impact for social entrepreneurial firms
examines scaling from what some may consider to be a
subjective perspective. We used a multi-item variable to
assess the ability of the firm to reach increasingly large
groups of potential customers, as well as to achieve
greater geographic reach as a way to scale its operations
in the future. However, we relied on self-reporting of
both the extent of bricolage usage and scaling outcomes
by the social entrepreneur. Although obtaining selfreported data from key informants is a common practice
in entrepreneurship research, this approach may result in
288 ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION Vol 16, No 4
Bricolage in social entrepreneurship
common method bias (Krishnan et al, 2006). However,
in resource-constrained entrepreneurial firms, the human
resources supporting the venture may be limited and
provide less of an opportunity for multiple respondents
per firm. Also, our sample was comprised only of social
entrepreneurs in resource-constrained environments and
we did not include a comparison sample of entrepreneurial businesses that might be seeking profit outcomes
more narrowly to determine whether they used bricolage
strategies and/or had similar interests in terms of scaling
for social outcomes. This may be an avenue for future
research; however, it may also be that profit-seeking
firms do not rely on bricolage to a large enough extent
to observe the same boundary conditions.
Senyard et al (2014) conclude that although they did
not find boundary effects on the positive outcomes of
excessive use of bricolage in effecting innovativeness,
additional research is still needed in this area. Our
findings contribute to the scarce entrepreneurial
bricolage literature examining the potential negative
effects of the overuse of bricolage. An interesting
avenue for future research may be to examine
innovativeness as a mediating variable between
bricolage and scaling of social impact, since we know
that bricolage already has a positive and significant
relationship with innovativeness (Senyard et al, 2014).
Also, as an extension of the current study, future
research could refine the dependent variable of scaling
of social impact into breadth impact and depth impact.
For instance, is the effect of bricolage on the impact
depth any different from its effect on impact breadth?
Conclusion
Entrepreneurial bricolage was found to have a positive
and significant relationship with the creation of greater
social impact in resource-constrained environments.
Further, a post hoc analysis suggests that this relationship should be interpreted with potential boundary
conditions in mind. An inverted U-shaped relationship
between bricolage and scaling for social impact advises
that bricolage can only take a company so far, and may
not be an effective long-term strategy. This research
represents one of only a few large-scale empirical
studies on bricolage in social entrepreneurship. We also
provide a new empirical tool to examine scaling in a
social entrepreneurial firm. Both of these contributions
will help to promote a continued move towards a
rigorous approach to studying the nature of bricolage
within social entrepreneurial firms.
